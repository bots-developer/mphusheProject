                    <p> Mphushe services will be enjoyed by all those who registered to be our clients, especially Loan-services. Non-Loan services will be offered to anyone who needs them as there will not be any financial ties to them. Loan services are for registered clients who are capable of paying back the loans. The amount of loans offered and payment period will vary from one client to another depending on their financial status.</p>
					
					<p> 
						In the same way, <i> Mphushe! </i> is a product that was designed to assist a client who is experiencing an unexpected financial need, and requires a financial “push start” so that they may get their personal finances back on track.
